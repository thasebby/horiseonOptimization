# Horiseon Update

## Description

There were four main goals for this project: to help with user accessibility, improve code readability, fix minor issues that might have been overlooked and to condense some of the provided CSS code. I approached this project with the mindset of trying to improve on an already available website. This solved issues in connectivity and will help ease anybody that decides to work on this project in the future.
